      I think it would be nice to have sounds of dogs that are different for each key 
      instead of single sounds when clicking on a key.

## Reflection Questions

1. If you used any outside resources to help complete your submission (websites, books, people, etc) list them here.
   <blockquote>
   I was able to complete this assignment only by using the given instructions so no outside resources other than
   https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_lists.asp w3schools whenever i forgot some html syntax and i used this link 
   https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_images.aspwhen to figure out how to link the pictures in style.css.
   </blockquote>   
2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words)
  <blockquote>
  I would say the most challenging part that I have encountered when creating this submission is that I was a little rusty with some 
  of the concepts/strategies of web developments and had to figure them out on the way by using websites like w3schools.com. 
  In the past, I used python and flask to do projects like this and never used javascript to create interactive webpages so 
  this was a fun and challenging experience. I had to learn new debugging techniques like cousole.log() and figure out 
  why the code I wrote wasn't working, as well as figure out what was going on in a particular line of code and add logic. 
  Another challenge was deciding on a pattern; because I was only doing one difficulty level, I didn't know how difficult or 
  easy I wanted to make the game. So I created link to another page for both easy and hard difficulty, allowing the players 
  to choose which level they want to start if they find the default game too easy or difficult. The easy page only has four 
  keys and less complex and easy to remember patterns, while the hard page has eight keys and much more complicated combinations. 
  Working on this submission has taught me a lot of useful skills.

3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words)
  <blockquote>
  I was wondering if I wanted to let players/users be able to signup/login what would be the best way to store user information
  so that users can signup and login and be able to keep track of the levels to allow the website to track user actions and behavior 
  to provide a better experience to the user. I was thinking maybe implimenting a structured query language to store the user data, 
  but I don't know if there's a better way to do that for this specific project.  
  </blockquote>

4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words)
      <blockquote>
      If I had a few more hours to work on this project I would definitely work on allowing users to register and log in with their personal information.
      I also considered making a home page where players could choose many different levels and have the instruction page and other information on the home page, 
      but I didn't want to overcomplicate things mess with what I had, so I kept it the same and added a link to another page on the index.html page that
      contains instructions on how to play the game and a link to easy/hard page but if I had more time, I would have a home page and different branches from the
      home page. Another feature I wanted to include was to have dog sounds for each dog picture when pressing on a specific key instead of having a single tone.
