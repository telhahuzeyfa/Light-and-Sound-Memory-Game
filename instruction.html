            The basic concept of this game is straightforward: the player must
            memorize and replicate a series of keys. The goal of the game is to
            recreate the longest sequence of images/sounds possible by
            memorizing what happened at each step and press on the correct one.
          </strong>
        </li>
      </p>
    </div>
    <ol>
      <li>
        When you start the game, one of the six keys lights up at random,
        displaying cute dog images and playing a sound associated with that
        key/image.
      </li>

      <li>
        Your objective is to keep track of the number of keys displayed and
        press on the correct one.
      </li>

      <li>
        After that, you must remember what was shown earlier and combine it with
        the new key.
      </li>
      <li>
        You only have one opportunity to get the correct combination in this
        game, so if you make a mistake in the middle, you'll have to restart the
        game and start over.
      </li>
      <li>
        You will be the winner if you successfully combine all of the
        possibilities.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <li>
      Best of luck!!!
